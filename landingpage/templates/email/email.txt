Hey {{name}}, 
I'm Waithaka Waweru, the co-founder of Elimisha Africa and I'd like to personally thank you for signing up to our service. 
We established Elimisha Africa in order to teach our students coding and bridge the gap in the education system. 
I'd love to hear what you think of Elimisha Africa and if there is anything we can improve.
